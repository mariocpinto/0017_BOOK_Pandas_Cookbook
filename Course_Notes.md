## Pandas Cookbook: Course Notes

These are my notes as I worked through the [Pandas Cookbook](https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook) by [Julia Evans](http://jvns.ca/).

* [A quick tour of the IPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jvns/pandas-cookbook/blob/master/cookbook/A%20quick%20tour%20of%20IPython%20Notebook.ipynb)
  * `Ctrl+Enter` causes in place execution of a cell.
  * `Shift+Enter` causes execution of the cell + jumps to the next cell.
  * `Shift+tab` provides increasing amounts of help.
  * You can use tab completion for function names!
  * There are a number of _magic_ functions inbuilt: `%magic` provides a list and `%quickref` provides a quick reference guide.

* [Chapter 1: Reading from a CSV](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jvns/pandas-cookbook/blob/master/cookbook/Chapter%201%20-%20Reading%20from%20a%20CSV.ipynb)
